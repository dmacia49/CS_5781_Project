## Overview:

WakeUP!! is an innovative application designed to ensure you start your day on time and remain awake once your alarm goes off. Traditional alarm clocks allow for easy snoozing. Our application introduces a unique and engaging approach that requires users to complete a mental challenge before they can disable the alarm. Our innovative method directly addresses the issue of people struggling to get out of bed in the morning and often falling back asleep, which disrupts their morning routine and negatively impacts their day.
Our team recognized that many individuals face significant challenges with the overuse of the snooze button. Hitting the snooze button repeatedly may seem harmless, but it can lead to increased fatigue, disrupt the body's natural circadian rhythm, and contribute to longer-term sleep-related health problems. These disruptions not only make it harder to wake up on time but also diminish the overall quality of sleep, leaving individuals feeling more tired and less productive throughout the day. WakeUP!! addresses these challenges by implementing a series of mental exercises that users must complete to turn off their alarms. These challenges are carefully designed to stimulate cognitive functions, thereby ensuring that users fully engage their minds upon waking. The application helps users transition more smoothly from sleep to awake, reducing the temptation to return to bed.
The mental challenges will range in difficulty and variety, ensuring that the user experience remains fresh and engaging. This not only makes the waking-up process more interactive and intentional. WakeUP!! provides an opportunity to establish a more disciplined and structured morning routine. Our application encourages users to wake up at a consistent time each day, which can reinforce the body's natural sleep-wake cycle and improve overall sleep quality. By reducing the likelihood of oversleeping and the negative impacts of snooze button abuse, WakeUP!! serves as a tool for enhancing both physical and mental well-being.

## Functionality:

1. **Setting up alarm:** Like any other alarm app, users can set their alarm by the time, date, day, and such.
2. **Running in the background:** Once the alarm goes off, the user cannot just turn it off by removing it from the notification like the traditional apps. The app will keep running in the background until the puzzles are solved.
3. **Solve challenges to snooze or turn off:** Only after solving a set of puzzles, the user will be able to snooze or turn the alarm off.
4. **Save user patterns:** The app will save user patterns based on their usage behavior. If they keep on snoozing the alarm multiple times, the puzzles will get harder to solve, ensuring they wake up without going back to bed again.
5. **Option to turn off certain challenges:** Users can turn off some of the challenges or puzzles that may be too hard for them to solve right after waking up. This will prevent the app from being more disruptive than being helpful and enjoyable.
6. **Timeout period:** There will be a timeout period after which the alarm will turn off automatically. This time can be 10-15 minutes. This will prevent the app from running in the background indefinitely.
